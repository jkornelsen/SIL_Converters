    // I think there's a compiler bug: I need to override the virtual function OnApply in the 
    //  sub-class of this class, AutoConfigDlg. But for some reason, it isn't being called. 
    //  I think the reason is that this class is defined in a static library which is used in 
    //  an DLL that dynamically links with the MFC DLLs. [Possibly making matters worse, the DLL 
    //  is such that it contains OLE/COM classes (i.e. so that it's not just a plane vanilla DLL, 
    //  but a COM DLL with class factories and all).]
    // Anyway, I suspect that the MFC OnNotify handler can't call virtual functions that are more 
    //  than once removed from the base class (CPropertyPage, in this case) in such a configuration. 
    //  So I'm overriding OnApply in *this* class (the first sub-class of CPropertyPage) because it 
    //  *is* being called in this case. I still need to give this class' sub-class, AutoConfigDlg, 
    //  a chance to handle OnApply, so I'm creating a (pure) virtual function here which is called 
    //  when OnApply is called. Now the sub-classes will get an opportunity to handle the OK and/or 
    //  Apply buttons.
    // P.S. It wasn't enough to simply make a virtual function; that wasn't working either. It had
    //  to be a pure virtual function. This means that the three sub-classes of this class (one 
    //  for the About tab, one for the Test tab, and one for the Setup tab) *all* have to implement
    //  this pure virtual function, even though only the last one really wants to do something 
    //  with it. 
    // Final note: the sub-class implementations should call the CPropertyPage::OnApply in their
    //  implementations (rather than the normal process of calling the immediate base class,
    //  CAutoConfigPropertyPage::OnApply, because otherwise, it'll be called recursively until
    //  the stack overflows...
